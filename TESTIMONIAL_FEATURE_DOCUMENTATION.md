# Testimonial Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive testimonial/review system that allows users to rate their appointments and veterinarians. The testimonials are stored in BOTH the appointments table (for tracking) AND the testimonials table (for public display). The approved testimonials are displayed as a modern auto-sliding carousel in the Testimonials.jsx component.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Appointment Model Updates (`Appointment.java`)
Added new fields to store testimonial data:
- `appointmentRating` (Integer 1-5): Rating for the overall appointment experience
- `doctorRating` (Integer 1-5): Rating for the veterinarian
- `reviewComment` (TEXT): Written review/feedback
- `reviewCreatedAt` (LocalDateTime): Timestamp when review was submitted

### 2. AppointmentService Updates (`AppointmentService.java`)
Added new methods:
- `addTestimonial()`: Save testimonial data to an appointment
- `getAppointmentsWithReviewsByVeterinarian()`: Fetch appointments with reviews for a specific vet

### 3. AppointmentController Updates (`AppointmentController.java`)
Added new endpoints:
- `POST /api/appointments/{id}/testimonial`: Submit a testimonial for an appointment
- `GET /api/appointments/veterinarian/{veterinarianId}/reviews`: Get all reviewed appointments for a vet

## Frontend Changes

### 1. New Component: TestimonialModal (`TestimonialModal.jsx`)
A beautiful modal component that allows users to:
- Rate their appointment experience (1-5 stars)

Features:

### 2. UserProfile Component Updates (`UserProfile.jsx`)
Enhanced the appointments section:
- Added "Rate Appointment" button to each appointment card
- Shows review status if already submitted (with star ratings)
- Opens TestimonialModal when button is clicked
- Refreshes appointments after testimonial submission

### 3. Testimonials Component Updates (`Testimonials.jsx`)
Added database integration and pause-on-hover functionality:
- Fetches approved testimonials from the testimonials table
- Displays testimonials in a beautiful auto-sliding carousel
- Shows client name, pet details, ratings, and review text
- **Pauses auto-slide when mouse hovers over testimonial area** ✨
- Includes dot indicators for manual navigation
- Click dots to jump to specific testimonials
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Fallback to default testimonials if database fetch fails

Features:

- **Pause on mouse interaction** (hover over testimonials area)
- Manual navigation via dot indicators
- Beautiful card design with rating stars
- Shows date of review
- Responsive layout
- Fetches from `/api/testimonials/approved` endpoint

### 4. Backend Testimonial Service & Controller Created
**New Files:**
- `TestimonialService.java`: Service layer for testimonial operations
- `TestimonialController.java`: REST API endpoints for testimonials

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/testimonials`: Get all testimonials
- `GET /api/testimonials/approved`: Get approved testimonials (for public display)
- `GET /api/testimonials/featured`: Get featured testimonials
- `GET /api/testimonials/{id}`: Get single testimonial
- `POST /api/testimonials`: Create testimonial
- `PUT /api/testimonials/{id}`: Update testimonial
- `PUT /api/testimonials/{id}/approve`: Approve testimonial (admin)
- `DELETE /api/testimonials/{id}`: Delete testimonial

### 5. API Service Updates (`api.jsx`)
Added new API endpoints:
- `appointments.addTestimonial()`: Submit testimonial (creates entries in BOTH tables)
- `testimonials.getApproved()`: Fetch approved testimonials for display
- Full CRUD operations for testimonials management

## Database Schema Changes Required

**The testimonials table already exists** with the following structure:
- `id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `customer_name`, `customer_email`, `customer_image_url`
- `title`, `content`, `pet_name`, `pet_type`, `service_type`
- `is_approved`, `is_featured`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

Run this SQL migration to add the new columns to the **appointments** table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE appointments
ADD COLUMN appointment_rating INT,
ADD COLUMN doctor_rating INT,
ADD COLUMN review_comment TEXT,
ADD COLUMN review_created_at TIMESTAMP;
```

**Why both tables?**
- **Appointments table**: Stores the rating data for tracking purposes (tied to specific appointment)
- **Testimonials table**: Stores approved public testimonials for display on the website

## User Flow

1. **User completes an appointment**
2. **In UserProfile page**, user sees their appointments list
3. **Click "Rate Appointment" button** on any appointment
4. **TestimonialModal opens** with:
   - Appointment details
   - Two rating sections (appointment & doctor)
   - Comment text area
5. **Submit review** - Validation ensures all fields are filled
6. **Success animation** shows confirmation
7. **Modal closes** and appointment card updates to show "Review Submitted"
8. **Reviews appear in AppointmentModal** for that veterinarian
